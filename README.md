## We all should be a hero

Nowadays, humanity has become too selfish. A lot of people do not have the essential to eat, sleep or have a moment for a simple shower. We have also animals that are abandoned or being treated cruelty. 

On the other hand, we have good heart people that make a lot of effort in order to help those who do not have a voice to fight.

In this regard, Be The Hero was born to get ONGs together in one easy and simple platform connecting them to people who are willing to help.

ONGs can share their incidents and needs for each case and users can check all incidents and help'em.

Therefore, the App's main purpose is to help non-governmental organizations (ONGs) - which are non-profit, citizen-based group that are involved in international philanthropic, developmental, or social missions -  for raising funds to their own projects.
